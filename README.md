# Cloud Journey (Public Proof Log)
**Why I'm here**
I’m transitioning into cloud to build a durable career, solve real problems, and create
options for my family.
**My Focus (next 90 days)**
- AWS foundations (IAM, S3, EC2, CloudWatch)
- IaC with Terraform
- Documenting every build (README, screenshots, LinkedIn)
**Week 1 – Identity & First Wins**
- Set up GitHub + LinkedIn for cloud visibility
- Wrote this public proof log
- Next up: S3 + IAM “Public Access Problem” lab
**Projects (live/soon)**
(whatever projects or workshops I will do)
**How I document**
Each project includes: problem → approach → commands/code → screenshots →
lessons learned → what I'd do differently.
**Contact/Connect**
- LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-mackrell/>
- Notes: If you’re hiring for junior cloud/security roles, I’m documenting proof every
week.
